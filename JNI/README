The make file expects libvpx.so to be located in x64/

Need to clone libvpx :
git clone http://git.chromium.org/webm/libvpx.git

and build it for x64 :
mkdir x64
cd x64
../libvpx/configure --enable-pic --enable-shared
make


To run Application.class :
make run
make display #(show single frame using imagemagick)
make play    #(use mplayer to play output)

Application.class expects to find foreman_cif.y4m in input.
It can be downloaded from http://media.xiph.org/video/derf/
